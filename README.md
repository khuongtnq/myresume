# myresume
Creating a Website with html css and bootstrap 4

My resume is a one-page document that outlines my work/volunteer/internship experience, skills, and 
educational background required by most job applications.

My resume should be persuasive. I am trying to include the best information possible to get the specific job I am applying for. Your resume should also be concise. 
It should be no longer than one page and should not use wordy language or fluff.
